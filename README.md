Battleships
===========

### Makers Academy Week 4 group task

This task was set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen
[@ecomba](http://twitter.com/ecomba) whilst learning to code at
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). The aim was to complete two
classes to a given specification that could be used by a working Battleships
app written by Enrique.

This was a group task and I worked with:
  - [Vinay Gupta](https://github.com/vinayngupta)
  - [Samantha Harris](https://github.com/Harrisam)
  - [Lorraine Phill](https://github.com/lorraine-phill)
  - [Deniss Bohanovs](https://github.com/violentr)

I paired with Lorraine and Deniss on the `Board` class. Samantha and Vinay
paired on the `Player` class.

Unfortunately we did not complete the task in the half day allocated, so this
code is unfinished and needs to be completed and refactored.
